## 🧭 Working Guidelines

- Clone the repository, switch to `main`, and open a project HTML file in the browser or via a static server.
- Iterate on styles and scripts with attention to maintainable structure and responsive behavior.
- Use `npx stylelint **/*.css` and `npx eslint **/*.js` when configurations are available.
- Document changes with focused commits and descriptive messages before pushing.

## 🎯 Standards

- Layouts remain stable from 320px through 1440px and larger displays.
- Animations stay purposeful, smooth, and performance conscious.
- Keyboard navigation, focus management, and aria labels are validated.

## 🤝 Contribution

- Fork or branch from `main`, keep work scoped, and update documentation as needed.
- Open a pull request that summarises intent, references supporting visuals, and responds to review.

## 🌱 Vision

Each project acts as a disciplined study in front-end craftsmanship, balancing clarity, accessibility, and performance to remain reliable over time.
